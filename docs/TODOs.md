# [Documentation](./README.md)

- Investigate how IaC Pipelines and/or Terragrunt may be a 3rd and improved option over directory or workspace use for decomposition/repetability.
- Learn about [Terragrunt](https://project-awesome.org/shuaibiyy/awesome-terraform) to see if it enables [IaC Pipelines](https://medium.com/@kief/https-medium-com-kief-using-pipelines-to-manage-environments-with-infrastructure-as-code-b37285a1cbf5).
- Investigate [Open Policy Agent](https://project-awesome.org/shuaibiyy/awesome-terraform) | [OPA is to Policy Automation as Terraform is to IaC](hhttps://www.scalr.com/blog/opa-is-to-policy-automation-as-terraform-is-to-iac/)
- Read [The Right Way to Store Secrets using Parameter Store](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/the-right-way-to-store-secrets-using-parameter-store/) and compare with use of [Vault](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vault/index.html) for secrets and other suggestions at [How can I manage secrets in .tf and .tfstate?](https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/79/how-can-i-manage-secrets-in-tf-and-tfstate)
- Look into Segment.io [Stack AWS](https://github.com/segmentio/stack) AWS Terraform configuration.
